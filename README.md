> **12 Nov 2026 — development integration, not a stable download:** the previous native CI compiled 1,588 objects but package staging failed. Updated PS5 source includes NS1 CPU6 ABI alignment, NS2 sparse guest memory, R09 source policies, launcher GL/Vulkan handoff and eight **opt-in-only** daily WebP backgrounds (no artwork bundled). **NS1 and NS2 boot remain unverified on a new PS5 candidate.** [33-case upstream integration register](docs/audits/ENCORE_NS1_GLOBAL_R23_33_GAPS_PR_BRANCH_HANDOFF_2026-11-12.md) · [unpublished R457 addendum](docs/audits/ENCORE_DRAFT_RELEASE_CHANGELOG_2026-11-12.md).

> **Exactly the 31 official PS5 system language/region choices; 31 launcher translation catalogs (including en-US and en-GB):** [Language directory](LANGUAGES.md). No extra launcher languages are exposed. This strict policy follows [Sony's official console-language list](https://www.playstation.com/fr-fr/legal/language-support/); translation/font quality still requires validation.

<a id="getting-started"></a>
## Start here — install in four steps

1. Choose a **complete Encore release package** from [Releases](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/releases). A green development CI job does not automatically mean it was tested on PS5.
2. **Back up** your old `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/` app, `/data/prosperoeden/` and any external storage root. The original native port uses the **same title ID**.
3. Follow [the complete installation guide](INSTALL.md) for **ZIP/FTP or FFPFSC/ShadowMountPlus**. Copy the full `PPSA99008/` app tree, including `ui/lang/`, not only `eboot.bin`.
4. Open Encore and check **Settings → Storage / Language**, game Library and existing saves. If anything fails, use [Troubleshooting](TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

**Language policy:** [exactly 31 Sony PS5 system choices, no extra languages](docs/PS5_SYSTEM_LANGUAGE_POLICY.md). The [language portal](LANGUAGES.md) now lists 31 separate variants and guide paths, including distinct US/UK English.

**Firmware 13.60 is the only console-tested target.** No earlier firmware minimum is verified, and this is not advice to update your PS5. [Choose any launcher language](LANGUAGES.md).

## ✨ Why Encore?

Emulation on a console is more than booting a game. It should be navigable from the couch, recoverable when settings go wrong and honest about what the hardware actually does.

| | What Encore brings |
| --- | --- |
| **🎮 TV-first experience** | TV-oriented launcher, game artwork, recent titles, controller navigation, quick settings and multilingual support. |
| **🧩 Game files and compression** | NSP, XCI, NSZ, XCZ, NRO, NSO, NCA, NAX and KIP selection; LZ4 and ZBIC/zstd decoding. Some files require extra program content to boot. |
| **🛟 Recovery without surprises** | One-session Safe Launch, confirmed resets and guarded migration without silently overwriting saved preferences. |
| **⚙️ Per-title profiles** | Minimum, Recommended, High and Ultra, plus Custom when you edit a preset. |
| **🎨 Graphics choices** | Vulkan/RADV and OpenGL, shader cache management, upscaling and anti-aliasing controls. |
| **🔍 Explainable performance** | Frame-time windows, guest/JIT activity, memory pressure, cache locks and IPC—not FPS alone. |
| **🔐 Safer native operation** | One-shot filesystem access, fail-closed recovery paths, bounded logs and package provenance checks. |

**Accessibility:** [Larger text, High contrast, Reduce motion and controller navigation](ACCESSIBILITY.md) are documented with known limitations.

**Our approach:** preserve a working native foundation, select and adapt upstream improvements, then validate **source → native package → real hardware** independently. **New here?** Start with [installation](INSTALL.md), [known limitations](#-compatibility--current-limits) and the [community FAQ](#faq).

<details>
<summary><strong>Encore vs the original port</strong></summary>

| Dimension | Original foundation | Encore's emphasis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware target | Broad upstream development | Firmware **13.60-focused** qualification |
| Launcher | Native frontend | TV-first hero, library, recents and quick settings |
| Content loading | Earlier formats | **NSP, XCI, NSZ, XCZ, NRO, NSO, NCA, NAX, KIP; LZ4 + ZBIC/zstd** |
| Recovery | Base defaults | Temporary Safe Launch and confirmed resets |
| Storage | Original path behavior | One internal/external root structure and guarded migration |
| Controller settings | Base mappings | Controller-first launcher profiles; game-owned actions still under investigation |
| Graphics | Upstream rendering | Pinned native adaptations and compiled-source evidence |
| Verification | Upstream test coverage | Host regressions, native packaging and device tests kept separate |

Encore is **not** an official upstream release or a promise that every newer upstream commit has been included.

## 🗺️ Roadmaps and upstream updates

- **[Full R00–R25 feature roadmap](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP_ENCORE_COLLAB_2026-10-25.md)** in the [historical R00–R25 planning document](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP_ENCORE_COLLAB_2026-10-25.md): graphics, FSR, frame generation, advanced AA, themes, network, trophies, library and the R21 application updater. **Planned or experimental does not mean shipped.**
- **[Unified NS1/NS2 roadmap](docs/ROADMAP_NS1_NS2_UNIFIED.md)**: common engine owners are now present on `main` and subject to finite P1/P2 host-exit contracts. The [historical second-generation research](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP_NS1_NS2_UNIFIED.md) is historical context; **the last published R1 native PS5 binary contains none of these later mainline changes**.
- **[PS5 stability and F07 tracker](docs/FC27_F07_MASTER_TRACKER.md)**: the main branch remains the source of truth for current PS5 engine work.
- **Upstream native updates are selective, not automatic.** The traceable Encore baseline is **ProsperoEden v1.000.040** ([fork notes](docs/FORK_NOTES.md)). New ProsperoEden/Eden changes are evaluated and adapted individually, with [upstream audits](docs/UPSTREAM_GAP_REGISTER_2026-10-14.md). The **R21 Encore in-app updater is planned, not currently shipped**.

## 📦 Game formats and executable compression

| Category | Formats | Current scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Library game containers | **NSP** (`.nsp`), **XCI** (`.xci`) | Existing game discovery and launch |
| Compressed game containers | **NSZ** (`.nsz`), **XCZ** (`.xcz`) | Experimental NCZ reader, games, updates and DLC; native and hardware qualification pending |
| Internal executable compression | **LZ4**, **ZBIC / zstd** | Existing NSO segment decoding; **not** game-file extensions |
| Direct-loader files | **NRO, NSO, NCA, NAX, KIP** | Selectable; successful execution depends on complete compatible contents. |

**Extracted ExeFS directories** are also discovered when `roms/<title>/` contains real, non-symlinked `main` and `main.npdm` files. They appear as `EXEFS` in the Library; this is a directory layout, not another ROM extension.

NCZ block compression permits random reads directly from the compressed file. Solid compression may unpack one running title to `/data/prosperoeden/user/cache/nsz/`; this can require approximately the full uncompressed game size. Outside a running game, bounded, validated pieces are reused for metadata reads. A developer build that contains the feature is not a console-tested release.

## 🚀 Install Encore

> [!TIP]
> For a tested release, use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/releases), read the release's **specific firmware/gameplay validation notes**, and verify checksums. GitHub Actions artifacts are experimental unless separately qualified.

**Available packaging paths when published:** full ZIP with the application folder; optional FFPFSC image. The native title ID is `PPSA99008`.

**Application folder:** `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/`.

**Persistent data root:** `/data/prosperoeden/`, containing `keys/`, `firmware/`, `roms/`, `updates/`, `mods/`, `save-import/` and `save-export/`.

Changing to external storage changes the **root**, not the subdirectory layout. Do **not** delete your persistent data root when upgrading an installation. Encore does not provide commercial software, keys, games or firmware.

**Replacing the original native ProsperoEden folder?** Both apps use title ID `PPSA99008` and the application directory `/data/homebrew/PPSA99008/`. **Back up that entire folder (including any old `assets/`), `/data/prosperoeden/` and any external data root first**; copy the complete Encore application tree over the native app without deleting legacy data, then launch and verify migration. This is an **in-place replacement**, not a second installation. Read the [native ProsperoEden → Encore upgrade guide](INSTALL.md#upgrade-from-native) before copying files. An original-upstream ZIP is **not** an Encore update.

**Full setup and upgrades:** [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) · [Build from source](docs/BUILDING.md) · [Support](SUPPORT.md).

## 🎛️ Built for the couch

| Feature | What to expect |
| --- | --- |
| **Home, Library, Recents** | Controller-friendly navigation, game metadata, cover/banner enrichment and offline fallback |
| **Animated game launch** | Real 3D rotating case with authentic scans per face when available. Missing front/back are reconstructed from cached game art, distinct screenshots, title and description by the native OpenGL renderer, without image generation. [Artwork details](docs/LAUNCH_CASE_ARTWORK.md) |
| **Quick Settings** | Per-title video changes without digging through debugging menus |
| **Video profiles** | **Minimum → Recommended → High → Ultra**; Custom after manual adjustment |
| **Safe Launch** | Conservative OpenGL, 1× internal resolution, 1080p, bilinear, handheld, 60 Hz and mods off for that run only |
| **Controls** | Native launcher mapping profiles, vibration and deadzones |
| **Languages** | Exactly **31 PS5 system language/region choices**, backed by 31 locale catalogs, including US and UK English; no extra language options beyond Sony's official list |
| **Visual tuning** | Resolution, filters, upscaling, sharpening and anti-aliasing options |

Safe Launch does **not** erase saves or permanently overwrite preferences. **Game-specific action binding** is distinct from the launcher's physical controller mapping, and is not yet fully proven for the main match test.

<details>
<summary><strong>Under the hood: CPU, graphics, JIT and memory</strong></summary>

- **Dynarmic remains the production JIT.** Experimental cross-core shared JIT and anticipatory compilation remain disabled in stable profiles due to unqualified concurrency/lifetime behavior.
- **Vulkan/RADV and OpenGL** are independent graphics routes. The native graphics build uses pinned source adaptations, tests, source fingerprints and archive checks rather than treating source presence as proof of compiled integration.
- **Shader cache** allocation and file size do not prove hit rate. Cold pipeline creation, long CPU waits and shader-cache reuse must be measured separately.
- **Memory** package declarations, sparse page tables, committed guest backing and JIT code-cache policies are not interchangeable. Current `main` source selects demand-backed sparse RX/RW JIT aliases, with physical backing reclaimed only after quiescent full-cache invalidation. This **post-R1 source configuration is not proof of what ran in the October 2026 released PS5 binary**; host checks exist, but memory savings and firmware-13.60 runtime stability on a newly compiled package remain unqualified.
- **Diagnostics** can distinguish a running compositor from actual guest progression; detailed capture has costs and is not automatically enabled in quiet gameplay.

See [Architecture](docs/PS5_NATIVE_ARCHITECTURE.md), [Performance roadmap](docs/PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md) and [Integration audit](docs/INTEGRATION_AUDIT_CPU_GPU_JIT_2026-10-14.md).

<a id="compatibility"></a>
## 🧪 Compatibility & current limits

| Target | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Firmware 13.60** | Device boot, launcher and selected title sessions | **Primary tested target** |
| Earlier firmware (minimum not established) | May work with compatible homebrew/runtime; no Encore device tests | **Unverified** |
| Later firmware | No Encore console qualification | **Unverified** |
| Newer NSO content | ZBIC/zstd and LZ4 source/native paths | **Implemented; title-dependent** |
| Main match test | Gameplay captured across full sessions | **Stutters and end-match freeze unresolved** |
| Adventure title sessions | Previously reported broadly playable | **Not a universal compatibility claim** |
| Custom game actions | Launcher mapping ≠ guest's saved control actions | **In-match persistence unresolved** |
| In-game HUD freshness | Graphics activity can outlive guest progress | **Under investigation** |

**Performance, stated accurately:** the last available full-match capture (`2efd8b3c`) recorded **858 frame intervals above 50 ms**, ten above 500 ms and a prolonged guest-progress stall while presentation remained active. Later changes have passed various source/native checks; **no matching later device capture proves these changes improved FPS or removed the freeze**.

[Read the measured stress analysis](docs/FC27_STRESS_REPLAY_2026-10-14.md) · [Gameplay recovery plan](docs/GAMEPLAY_FREEZE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md)

> [!WARNING]
> A 30 FPS compositor counter is not proof that a game is advancing. Encore does **not** promise universal title compatibility, 60 FPS, glitch-free HUD updates or automatic conversion of custom gameplay bindings.

### Native release baseline and post-R1 source development (9 November 2026)

The **last verified published native PS5 FTP binary** is [Encore R1 in the historical repository](https://github.com/niakw/Prospero.Eden-Encore/releases/tag/encore-R1-56293953), **published 15 October 2026** from an already successful [native build run #38752177232](https://github.com/niakw/Prospero.Eden-Encore/actions/runs/38752177232). Its release notes identify source **`5629395324ff65c98b50c44f35f2142a4a92654a`**; its historical Git tag points to **`f037a78f88c0097d2031996390d7816b11e45479`**. Those two references must not be conflated. The independent repository **mirrored the unchanged R1 assets on 30 October 2026**; that was **not** a fresh native compile. The FTP archive is `Eden-Encore-56293953-FTP-PPSA99008.zip`.

Current `main` has since evolved: common NS1/NS2 loader and firmware/key discovery, compressed-content and NUP work, HLE/IPC/memory and Ampere-to-Vulkan research, GPU synchronization, launcher/controller-overlay changes, spatial upscaling options (including preserved FSR 1), and optional R09 neural processing. These are **source/integration or host-validation states**, not features guaranteed in that October binary. In particular, a model manifest, host-linked executable, synthetic frame, software Vulkan image or passed SPIR-V check is **not** a complete authentic neural inference or a PS5-rendered result.

**Workflow semantics:** ordinary `main` pushes skip the native build; deliberate `workflow_dispatch` or an explicit `[full-build]` marker is required. Source preflight, Core fast gate, NS2 research guards, the 17-contract P1/P2 exit check, the P0–P4 host matrix and R09 host tests have **different scopes**. A `skipped` build, green host shard or uploaded public test kit cannot be presented as a new PS5 build. [Read the step-by-step workflow and post-R1 inventory](docs/RELEASE_BASELINE_WORKFLOW_AUDIT_2026-11-09.md).

## Changes in Encore R1

- A firmware-13.60-focused native port with a redesigned launcher, controller-first UX and one-session Safe Launch.
- ZBIC/zstd loading alongside the existing LZ4 path.
- Title-aware video presets, multilingual UI and guarded data migration.
- A pinned native graphics/toolchain integration with explicit provenance and regression checks.
- Reworked observability and crash-recovery paths, with open tracking of gameplay stutter, content freshness and saved in-game controls.

## 🛡️ Safety, independence and responsible use

Encore hardens one-shot filesystem operations and rejects unsafe migrations, but **filesystem access is not a post-elevation sandbox**. Bounded logs, pinned sources and automated checks reduce specific risks without making the environment infallible.

## ❓ FAQ — answers to the questions on X

Select a question to expand the answer. The detailed original-vs-Encore history is intentionally long: it covers the work **since 4 October 2026**, not only the 30 October public-repository rebrand.

<details>
<summary><strong>• What is the difference between Encore and the original ProsperoEden? What has actually changed since the project began?</strong></summary>

**Encore began on 4 October 2026**, first in the historical [Prospero.Eden-Encore fork](https://github.com/niakw/Prospero.Eden-Encore), then in this standalone repository from **30 October 2026**. It is an extensive continuation of the original PS5 port and Eden engine work, **not just a logo/name change**. Original upstream authors retain full attribution.

The following is a detailed **technical change inventory**: delivered source changes, test infrastructure, hardware observations and experimental investigations are explicitly distinguished. Some foundations already existed in ProsperoEden and were *retained or extended*, not invented from scratch. For individually tracked source files, revisions, commits and decisions—including no-change audits and reverted experiments—see [project history](MEMORY.md), [active-source catalog](docs/EDEN_ACTIVE_SOURCE_CATALOG.md), [engineering audit](docs/EDEN_CORE_AUDIT_DEPENDENCIES.md), [F07 functions](docs/F07_FUNCTION_SCOPE_2026-10-28.md) and the [complete commit history](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/commits/main/). **Auditing a function does not imply optimizing it; passing CI does not imply faster games.**

**1. Native PS5 platform, release process and project structure**
- Concentrated real-console testing on **PS5 firmware 13.60**; deliberately did not certify unsupported firmware.
- Preserved and adapted the native PS5 application, Eden emulator core, Dynarmic, native OpenGL and PS5 Vulkan/Mesa/RADV integrations.
- Standardized the launcher/application identity **PPSA99008** and native installation, package layout, shared storage and user-data paths.
- Consolidated around **one release profile** and one final installable package rather than multiple DEV/experimental variants.
- Added guarded startup, failure cleanup, bounded log/crash paths, recovery and checks of the actually selected native code paths.
- Refined packaging and reproducibility, exact-SHA executable and symbols matching, optional FFPFSC, and the prohibition of nested ZIPs.
- Selected/pinned upstream engine fixes, compiler/runtime adaptations, SDK/Mesa/Vulkan/OpenGL dependencies and reproducible source manifests.
- Audited transitive source integration and proved which upstream/backport overrides are selected in the compiled archive; rejected incomplete or unverified integrations.
- Migrated the large **vendor** tree to an immutable, pinned Git submodule; preserved matching dependency sources and licenses. MihawkGen, FSR3 Optical Flow and libwebp 1.6.0 are pinned unmodified third-party source snapshots under `vendor/sources/` (not additional submodules). `vendor/encore-active/` is reserved exclusively for Encore-maintained runtime overrides and ports; original upstream dependency trees must never be stored there.
- Compacted Git history while retaining recovery archives and provenance; migrated to an independent public repository with restored branches/tags/releases where applicable.
- Established fast/full host gates, native build/package gates, static security analysis (including CodeQL), checksum/source checks and firmware-specific console-test checklists.
- Kept code review, build results and on-device qualification **separate**, including a distinct record for source-only and experimental patches.
- Expanded source-level regression harnesses, sanitizers, O0/O2 fixtures, GPU/HLE emulation models, exact compiled-source checks and historical audit registers.
- References: [native build](docs/BUILDING.md), [release policy](docs/EDEN_ONE_SHIPPING_PROFILE_2026-10-26.md), [standalone migration](docs/STANDALONE_REPOSITORY_MIGRATION_2026-10-30.md), [vendor migration](docs/VENDOR_SUBMODULE_MIGRATION.md), [repository history](docs/REPO_HISTORY_COMPACTION_2026-10-30.md).

**2. Game formats, executable loading, library and storage**
- Extended newer **NSO** handling with **ZBIC/zstd**, alongside existing **LZ4** segment decompression, with validation of compressed executable boundaries.
- Retained and extended discovery/selection of **NSP, XCI, NRO, NSO, NCA, NAX and KIP**. Being selectable is not a promise of successful execution without complete supporting content.
- Added experimental **NSZ/XCZ** (NCZ) game/update/DLC reading, block-compressed random access, bounded metadata reads and controlled solid-file extraction/cache behavior.
- Added extracted **ExeFS directory** discovery when genuine <code>main</code> and <code>main.npdm</code> are present; rejected unsafe symlinks.
- Improved invalid-file rejection, compression and decompression error recovery, size limits, path validation, cancellation and temporary storage accounting.
- Consolidated the internal/external data-root layout for keys, firmware, ROMs, updates, mods, user settings, game caches and save import/export.
- Added safer migration/reset paths that do not silently erase stored preferences, saves or content.
- Reviewed title metadata, game updates, runtime file access, firmware-dependent behavior and assorted Eden HLE/loader backports.
- References: [content-format matrix](docs/CONTENT_FORMAT_MATRIX_2026-10-23.md), [installation](INSTALL.md), [upstream gaps](docs/UPSTREAM_GAP_REGISTER_2026-10-14.md).

**3. CPU, Dynarmic, JIT, memory and fastmem**
- Investigated **AArch64/AArch32 Dynarmic**, guest thread progression, exclusive/atomic operations, JIT compile/invalidation waits, scheduling and PS5 logical processor allocation.
- Introduced the one selected **sparse JIT RX/RW allocator** with paired virtual aliases and physical memory committed in **2 MiB** units on demand.
- Added alias/probe preflight at title launch and fail-closed behavior rather than silently falling back to the old dense native JIT.
- Implemented physical backing reclamation after **complete quiescent JIT invalidation**, preserving RX/RW permissions and guest code lifetime.
- Optimized sparse table capacity, scan bounds, reservation epochs, positive/negative hit memoization, cross-arena reuse, alternative lookup slots and RX→RW alias lookup.
- Improved page-map ownership, guest memory access bounds, empty-span handling, range/alignment checks, physical-backed-page accounting and invalidation granularity.
- Reduced repeated **fastmem Map/Unmap/Protect** updates for unchanged pages and permissions, one-page and cross-granule cases; preserved error/failure retries and alias coherency.
- Audited JIT pressure, cache sizing, guest RAM vs PS5 physical allocations, temporary memory, GPU memory and high-resolution/OOM interactions.
- Evaluated—but **did not enable in the shipping profile**—shared cross-core JIT, speculative/background translation, unsafe DMA reordering and other concurrency-sensitive experiments.
- Reduced some proved thread/fiber stack and short-span allocation costs; these optimizations do **not** imply extra console RAM or guaranteed FPS.

**4. Maxwell, GPU queues, synchronization and native memory**
- Reviewed/fixed portions of **Maxwell DMA**, host1x, GPU scheduler, command FIFOs, transfer extents, fence publication, queue-slot lifetimes and safe stop/restart behavior.
- Applied bounded batching of selected DMA work, buffer invalidations and GPU copy operations without bypassing dependencies or replaying guest commands.
- Improved dirty-span tracking, guest-write coherency, texture/buffer registration, fast small-page ownership probes and safe range checks.
- Audited/guarded indirect draw bindings, null descriptors, vertex/index buffers, compute graphics-resource slot limits and shader-local bounds.
- Reduced GPU-queue wakeups, unnecessary synchronization and certain allocations where source-extracted tests establish equivalent execution.
- Added checks separating actual guest progress from a compositor/GPU worker that continues presenting stale frames.

**5. Vulkan/RADV shaders, pipelines, rasterization and textures**
- Integrated and source-pinned native **Mesa/RADV** and Vulkan adaptations, shader/compiler compatibility work and independent OpenGL fallback.
- Optimized verified shader/pipeline lookup hot paths, vertex-shader identities, small multi-key compute-pipeline memo tables and invalidation-aware hit/miss caches.
- Improved release/acquire publication of ready pipelines, safe failure of optional pipeline optimizations and descriptor preflight/reuse while preserving ordered draws.
- Reduced repeated work and some lock contention in shader caches, pipeline creation, descriptor rings, rasterizer and sampler state.
- Addressed **TIC/TSC** sampler/texture mappings, invalid/empty texture views, image aliases, framebuffer-view selection and cache invalidation.
- Refined image upload/download staging, asynchronous decode and unswizzle, BCn/3D texture batches, failure rollback, GPU-dirty state and texture eviction safeguards.
- Fixed or safeguarded **DrawTexture** state invalidation, blit/copy/resolve boundaries, render-target changes, raw framebuffer stride/pitch, missing guest framebuffer and presentation freshness.
- Improved Vulkan swapchain acquire/present recreation, surface-loss bounded retries, synchronization of in-flight layers and resource retirement by real GPU timeline ticks.
- Coalesced Vulkan presenter/worker wakeups and drain notifications, reduced unnecessary lock hold during GPU recycler allocation and avoided redundant AA rebuilds.
- Optimized frequent one-page guest-buffer/texture registration and ownership checks, repeated vertex classification and framebuffer pixel-size lookup.
- Reviewed **38 specific F07 functions across eight source files** covering cold shaders, pipeline waits, rasterizer/buffer contention and HUD/texture freshness.
- **Still open:** first-use guest IR→SPIR-V translation can block; a Vulkan worker may wait for a required pipeline; the black/delayed HUD and full-match frame pacing need console evidence.

**6. HLE, IPC, display, audio, input and networking**
- Reviewed guest **HLE kernel/service scheduling**, IPC waits, event handoffs, slab bounds, thread stop/restart and service-owner lifetime.
- Investigated **NVNflinger / BufferQueue / SurfaceFlinger / NvDisp / display layers**, distinguishing a true game freeze from an image/present problem.
- Audited audio initialization, PCM overflow, ring buffers, mixer/upmix paths and native output threading; reduced selected redundant audio copies/allocations.
- Improved native **DualSense** polling and mappings: batched immutable inverse mapping, precomputed stick curves/trigger LUTs, deadzones, button-edge semantics and vibration lock boundaries.
- Removed repeated controller scratch clearing, unnecessary sample copies and quiet-poll diagnostic work; retained guest action mapping isolation.
- Reviewed guest networking and DNS/socket behavior (including **NanoDNS**), access policies, bootstrap and runtime errors without promising Nintendo online support.
- Improved quiet/crash-only logging so diagnostics are available without continuously doing high-cost per-frame work.
- References: [input/glyph pipeline](docs/PS5_INGAME_GLYPHS.md), [guest IPC findings](docs/PS5_R393_2026-10-12_GUEST_IPC_THREAD_DIAGNOSTICS.md), [network audit](docs/PS5_R296_2026-10-10_NETWORK_AUDIT_NANODNS.md), [audio/engine inventory](docs/EDEN_CORE_AUDIT_DEPENDENCIES.md).

**7. Launcher, controller-first UX, media and translations**
- Expanded the TV-first **Home, Library and Recents** presentation, game metadata, artworks, banners, screenshots, quick settings and offline fallback.
- Added/extended animated **3D game-case** launch artwork with authentic front/back scans where present, and native reconstruction from available art for missing sides.
- Introduced/refined **Minimum / Recommended / High / Ultra / Custom** per-title video presets, override rules, manual graphics options and recovery-oriented **Safe Launch** for a single session.
- Added launch-time settings for internal resolution, Vulkan/OpenGL, filtering, sharpening and AA, with conservative memory constraints rather than unqualified 4× promises.
- Aligned the native launcher with the **31 official PS5 system language/region selections** and 31 maintained translation catalogs and improved complex/bidirectional text layout, fallback fonts, wrapping and glyph drawing.
- Tuned font fitting, font scratch reuse, audio ring copy behavior, controller navigation, scene transitions and costly UI/media work.
- Added/reviewed PS5-profile-avatar **read-only, async** retrieval paths; availability on every real console remains unverified.
- Investigated PlayStation in-game glyph assets, per-game mods and physical button mapping; **universal PlayStation glyph replacement is not implemented**.
- Improved accessibility guidance, high-contrast/reduced-motion support, safe settings reset, and user-data migration confirmation.
- Updated screenshots and preview disclaimers: the Home screenshot uses real renderer output but **fictional sample games**.
- References: [launcher audit](docs/EDEN_RELEASE_LAUNCHER_SOURCE_OPTIMIZATION_AUDIT_2026-10-26.md), [game-case media](docs/LAUNCH_CASE_ARTWORK.md), [accessibility](ACCESSIBILITY.md), [glyph research](docs/PS5_INGAME_GLYPHS.md).

**8. Stability work, profiling and tested games**
- Built frame-time/window diagnostics for FPS drops, long presentation stalls, GPU queue pressure, shader cold misses, JIT waits, mutex contention and guest IPC progression.
- Investigated **FC27** match play, half-time/pause/end-of-match crashes or freezes, intermittent black/late HUD overlays, cold shader spikes and user control profiles.
- Used **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** as a separate gameplay/memory comparator; this is not universal game compatibility proof.
- Recorded quiet-vs-detailed-logging and old-vs-cleared-shader-cache runs; showed that detailed logging itself can materially affect pacing.
- Investigated anti-aliasing/upscaling memory pressure and OOM at aggressive resolution settings; retained conservative device safeguards.
- Defined P0 blockers: **(1)** first-use shader translation, **(2)** ordered Vulkan pipeline wait, **(3)** buffer/texture cache contention, **(4)** HUD image/texture freshness.
- Tracked JIT, HLE, presentation, textures, glyphs and input as related—but distinct—owners rather than claiming a single FPS knob solves all.
- Retained regression checks and incident reports for frame pacing, guest-progress stalls and GPU presentation despite no game progress.
- References: [FC27 master tracker](docs/FC27_F07_MASTER_TRACKER.md), [real-console analysis](docs/FC27_STRESS_REPLAY_2026-10-14.md), [freeze recovery](docs/GAMEPLAY_FREEZE_RECOVERY_PLAN.md), [closure criteria](docs/PS5_CLOSURE_CRITERIA.md).

**9. Planned or experimental work — not part of a verified PS5 release**
- **Frame generation:** native frame pacing/stability first; future exploration of temporal upscaling, frame interpolation and optional frame generation. Do not treat these as available now.
- **FSR/AA/120 Hz:** deeper spatial/temporal upscaling, image quality, x2/x4 AA and higher refresh are design/research targets, subject to title and memory limits.
- **Switch 2 / NSW2:** shared NS1/NS2 loader, HLE, CPU and GPU code is under active development on **`main`**, using host-gated owners and the P0–P4 roadmap. These changes **postdate the last published PS5 R1 package**; no first guest-rendered NS2 PS5 frame or stable game compatibility has been demonstrated.
- **Cross-core JIT, speculative compilation, deferred GPU paths:** preserved as research/disabled experiments where concurrency or correctness proof is missing.
- **In-game PS button glyph replacement, avatar reliability, per-game input persistence and game-specific 60 FPS unlocks:** active investigation, not universal shipping promises.
- References: [performance roadmap](docs/PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md), [branch policy](docs/DEVELOPMENT_BRANCH_POLICY.md), [glyph research](docs/PS_GLYPH_INPUT_PIPELINE.md).

**A complete change history is not a single FPS claim:** source reviews, reverted prototypes, CI-only fixes and documentation changes are recorded in [MEMORY.md](MEMORY.md) and [commits](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/commits/main/). The list above summarizes the entire *scope* of Encore's work since its inception; the linked technical registers provide the individual-file detail. Real device qualification is deliberately narrower than the implementation inventory.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Was frame generation removed? When is it coming back?</strong></summary>

- Stability, frame pacing, input latency and image freshness come first. Shipping frame interpolation on top of freezes would make the counter look better, not fix the game.
- Encore intends to offer a better-managed frame-generation solution than the earlier implementation, but **it is not currently a verified shipping feature**. Research includes temporal/spatial upscaling and optional interpolation once the underlying rendering path is reliable.
- This is a **short-term priority following core optimizations**, not a fixed release date. See [performance roadmap](docs/PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Can Encore play Nintendo Switch 2 games?</strong></summary>

- **Not in the current PS5 release.** The [second-generation research roadmap](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP_NS1_NS2_UNIFIED.md) and its [feasibility report](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/NS2_PS5_FEASIBILITY_2026-10-30.md) cover loading, shader/CPU compatibility and homebrew execution paths.
- A successful source test or homebrew harness is **not** proof that a commercial Switch 2 title runs. No stable compatibility, 30 FPS Mario Kart World performance or supported Switch 2 game-file matrix is claimed.
- The existing Switch 1 path remains the main development focus on PS5. Research: [branch policy](docs/DEVELOPMENT_BRANCH_POLICY.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• How well does Encore run on PS5 right now?</strong></summary>

- **Firmware 13.60** is the primary version with device testing, not universal compatibility.
- FC27 has reached match gameplay but still exhibits shader/frametime spikes, HUD errors and pause/half-time/end-match freezes in documented tests.
- Zelda: Breath of the Wild has shown comparatively good sessions, but individual games, settings and builds vary.
- There is no general guarantee of a steady 30 FPS, 60 FPS, 120 Hz or flawless controls. See [console findings](docs/FC27_F07_MASTER_TRACKER.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Does the project improve FPS, or just redesign the launcher?</strong></summary>

- Both engine and frontend have meaningful code changes: JIT memory and fastmem, Vulkan caching/synchronization, textures, game loading, HLE, controller input and launcher.
- **Host regression passes and fewer operations do not prove PS5 FPS gains**. The exact console gain is still pending comparable real-device tests.
- The current priority is stable frame times and correct game progression, not an inflated FPS counter.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Is 60/120 FPS, better FSR or 2×/4× anti-aliasing supported?</strong></summary>

- Existing graphics settings include resolution, filters/upscaling and AA choices, but a title's native rate, the emulator's frame pacing and the PS5 memory budget impose separate limits.
- Better FSR, temporal techniques, 60/120 Hz handling and higher AA quality are planned/researched. **They are not promises of universally working or unlocked frame rates**.
- Aggressive internal scaling can exhaust graphics memory. See [roadmap](docs/PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Which PS5 firmware is supported?</strong></summary>

- **Recommended/tested for Encore: 13.60.** This identifies our evidence base, not a recommendation to update your console.
- **Earlier firmware may work**, depending on the PS5 exploit/homebrew setup, filesystem access, graphics driver and native APIs. **Minimum firmware: unknown; no older Encore version has been hardware-qualified.**
- Original ProsperoEden reports **6.02 and 12.70** tests of its Lapy filesystem helper ([upstream notes](https://github.com/Swordpdf/ProsperoEden/blob/main/README.md)), but **Encore uses a different v1.000.040-derived filesystem-access mechanism** ([fork notes](docs/FORK_NOTES.md)). Those component tests **do not prove Encore compatibility**.
- Newer firmware remains unverified. Check the release notes and exact tested SHA.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Which game file formats can I use? Are NSP and XCI enough?</strong></summary>

- Library containers: **NSP, XCI**.
- Compressed containers: experimental **NSZ, XCZ**, with format and hardware-qualification limitations.
- Direct selections: **NRO, NSO, NCA, NAX, KIP**, plus correctly structured extracted ExeFS directories.
- **LZ4 and ZBIC/zstd are executable-segment compression methods**, not games or installable file extensions. Some selected files cannot run without companion content. [Full matrix](docs/CONTENT_FORMAT_MATRIX_2026-10-23.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Can I use my DualSense and see PlayStation button symbols inside games?</strong></summary>

- The **launcher** supports controller-first navigation, DualSense mapping, deadzones and vibration options.
- The **game's own saved action mapping** and **in-game Switch button artwork** are separate. PlayStation glyph replacement is not universal; some in-match custom mapping still needs validation.
- See [glyph and input research](docs/PS5_INGAME_GLYPHS.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Is the download an actual PS5 release? Does green CI mean it works?</strong></summary>

- GitHub Actions verifies source/host tests, security and native packaging as separate gates. An artifact is **not necessarily a tested stable release**.
- Prefer a published [Release](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/releases) with explicit device-test notes and the matching SHA/checksum.
- A console session is required to confirm real gameplay, frame pacing, HUD, controls and safe return to the launcher.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Is Encore official? Can you provide Switch/PS5 games, keys or firmware?</strong></summary>

- Encore is an **unofficial community continuation**, with independent changes based on the credited original ProsperoEden and Eden work.
- No commercial games, firmware, proprietary keys or unauthorized downloads are distributed. Use content and system files you have the legal right to use.
- See [credits](#credits), [licenses](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) and [installation](INSTALL.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Does Encore automatically follow updates from the original native ProsperoEden? Is there a built-in updater?</strong></summary>

- **No automatic upstream merges.** The original **ProsperoEden v1.000.040** is Encore’s documented baseline; subsequent native-port and Eden updates are reviewed and integrated selectively, preserving PS5 Vulkan/JIT compatibility and testing. A newer upstream release is **not necessarily part of Encore**.
- **No built-in updater is available in the current shipping release.** Feature milestone **R21** describes manual checking, an optional startup check, verified Encore-release downloads, user confirmation and safe rollback; it is **a specification, not a released feature**. [Full roadmap](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP_ENCORE_COLLAB_2026-10-25.md).
- For now, use **[Encore Releases](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/releases)** and the [upgrade guide](INSTALL.md). **Do not overwrite Encore with an original ProsperoEden ZIP** merely because it has a higher version: application ID **PPSA99008** and storage paths can overlap, although code and migration behavior differ.
- References: [original native ProsperoEden](https://github.com/blackbearreloaded/ProsperoEden), [upstream gap audit](docs/UPSTREAM_GAP_REGISTER_2026-10-14.md), [native-version review](docs/UPSTREAM_PROSPEROEDEN_1001000_R428.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>• Why so many commits, what remains, and when will the next update arrive?</strong></summary>

- Many commits are deliberately small source changes, regression fixtures or CI corrections. They are **not** one new feature per commit.
- Remaining high-priority work concerns first-use shaders, Vulkan pipeline waits, texture/buffer cache contention, HUD freshness, guest freezes and real-console confirmation.
- Work is progressing quickly, but **there is no verified release date**. Updates appear in [commits](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/commits/main/), [Actions](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/actions), and [Releases](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore/releases).

## Credits

**Encore project history — development since 4 October 2026.** Our work began on **4 October 2026** in the [original `niakw/Prospero.Eden-Encore` fork](https://github.com/niakw/Prospero.Eden-Encore). On **30 October 2026**, we moved that work to this [independent repository](https://github.com/niakw/ProsperoEden-Encore) to make Encore easier to discover. The former fork remains linked as part of the project's history; this repository move does **not** reset Encore's development start date or replace the upstream credits below.
